# FAI disk configuration for Ubuntu Desktop (non-encrypted)
# Standard partitioning scheme with ext4 filesystem

# Disk selection - target the largest available disk
# This will be overridden by dynamic configuration if specific targeting is needed
disk_config disk1 disklabel:gpt bootable:1

# EFI System Partition (required for UEFI boot)
primary /boot/efi 512M vfat rw,createoptions="-F 32"

# Boot partition (separate for better compatibility)
primary /boot 1G ext4 rw,relatime

# Root partition (uses remaining space)
primary / 0- ext4 rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro

# Alternative configuration for legacy BIOS systems
# Uncomment if UEFI is not available
# disk_config disk1 disklabel:msdos bootable:1
# primary /boot 512M ext4 rw,relatime
# primary / 0- ext4 rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro
# primary swap 4G swap sw

# Swap file configuration (preferred over swap partition for flexibility)
# This will be configured post-installation via scripts

# Mount options for better performance and security
# Root filesystem: errors=remount-ro for safety
# Boot filesystem: relatime for performance

# Notes:
# - This configuration assumes UEFI boot (most modern systems)
# - Swap is configured as a file rather than partition for flexibility
# - All partitions use ext4 for maximum compatibility
# - Boot partition is separate for kernel upgrade safety
